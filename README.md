### Requirements

- Node.js 18+ and npm

### Getting started

Run the following command on your local environment:

```shell
npm install
```

For your information, all dependencies are updated every month.

Then, you can run the project locally in development mode with live reload by executing:

```shell
npm run dev
```

Open http://localhost:3000 with your favorite browser to see your project.

### Translation (i18n) setup

For translation, the project uses `next-intl` combined with [Crowdin](https://l.crowdin.com/next-js). As a developer, you only need to take care of the English (or another default language) version. Translations for other languages are automatically generated and handled by Crowdin. You can use Crowdin to collaborate with your translation team or translate the messages yourself with the help of machine translation.

To set up translation (i18n), create an account at [Crowdin.com](https://l.crowdin.com/next-js) and create a new project. In the newly created project, you will be able to find the project ID. You will also need to create a new Personal Access Token by going to Account Settings > API. Then, in your GitHub Actions, you need to define the following environment variables: `CROWDIN_PROJECT_ID` and `CROWDIN_PERSONAL_TOKEN`.

After defining the environment variables in your GitHub Actions, your localization files will be synchronized with Crowdin every time you push a new commit to the `main` branch.

### Customization

- `public/app-logo.svg`, `public/favicon.ico`, `public/favicon-16x16.png` and `public/favicon-32x32.png`: your website favicon
- `src/utils/AppConfig.ts`: configuration file
- `src/templates/BaseTemplate.tsx`: default theme
- `next.config.mjs`: Next.js configuration
- `.env`: default environment variables

### Commit Message Format

The project follows the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) specification, meaning all commit messages must be formatted accordingly. To help you write commit messages, the project uses [Commitizen](https://github.com/commitizen/cz-cli), an interactive CLI that guides you through the commit process. To use it, run the following command:

```shell
npm run commit
```

One of the benefits of using Conventional Commits is the ability to automatically generate a `CHANGELOG` file. It also allows us to automatically determine the next version number based on the types of commits that are included in a release.

### Testing

All unit tests are located alongside the source code in the same directory, making them easier to find. The project uses Vitest and React Testing Library for unit testing. You can run the tests with the following command:

```shell
npm run test
```

### Integration & E2E Testing

The project uses Playwright for integration and end-to-end (E2E) testing. You can run the tests with the following commands:

```shell
npx playwright install # Only for the first time in a new environment
npm run test:e2e
```

In the local environment, visual testing is disabled, and the terminal will display the message `[percy] Percy is not running, disabling snapshots.`. By default, visual testing only runs in GitHub Actions.

### Enable Edge runtime (optional)

The App Router folder is compatible with the Edge runtime. You can enable it by adding the following lines `src/app/layouts.tsx`:

```tsx
export const runtime = 'edge';
```
### Deploy to production

Then, you can generate a production build with:

```shell
$ npm run build
```

It generates an optimized production build of the boilerplate. To test the generated build, run:

```shell
$ npm run start
```

You also need to defined the environment variables `CLERK_SECRET_KEY` using your own key.

This command starts a local server using the production build. You can now open http://localhost:3000 in your preferred browser to see the result.

### Error Monitoring

The project uses [Sentry](https://sentry.io/for/nextjs/?utm_source=github&utm_medium=paid-community&utm_campaign=general-fy25q1-nextjs&utm_content=github-banner-nextjsboilerplate-logo) to monitor errors. In the development environment, no additional setup is needed: Next.js Boilerplate is pre-configured to use Sentry and Spotlight (Sentry for Development). All errors will automatically be sent to your local Spotlight instance, allowing you to experience Sentry locally.

For production environment, you'll need to create a Sentry account and a new project. Then, in `next.config.mjs`, you need to update the `org` and `project` attributes in `withSentryConfig` function. Additionally, add your Sentry DSN to `sentry.client.config.ts`, `sentry.edge.config.ts` and `sentry.server.config.ts`.

### Code coverage

Next.js Boilerplate relies on [Codecov](https://about.codecov.io/codecov-free-trial/?utm_source=github&utm_medium=paid-community&utm_campaign=general-fy25q1-nextjs&utm_content=github-banner-nextjsboilerplate-logo) for code coverage reporting solution. To enable Codecov, create a Codecov account and connect it to your GitHub account. Your repositories should appear on your Codecov dashboard. Select the desired repository and copy the token. In GitHub Actions, define the `CODECOV_TOKEN` environment variable and paste the token.

Make sure to create `CODECOV_TOKEN` as a GitHub Actions secret, do not paste it directly into your source code.

### Checkly monitoring

The project uses [Checkly](https://www.checklyhq.com/?utm_source=github&utm_medium=sponsorship&utm_campaign=next-js-boilerplate) to ensure that your production environment is always up and running. At regular intervals, Checkly runs the tests ending with `*.check.e2e.ts` extension and notifies you if any of the tests fail. Additionally, you have the flexibility to execute tests from multiple locations to ensure that your application is available worldwide.

To use Checkly, you must first create an account on [their website](https://www.checklyhq.com/?utm_source=github&utm_medium=sponsorship&utm_campaign=next-js-boilerplate). After creating an account, generate a new API key in the Checkly Dashboard and set the `CHECKLY_API_KEY` environment variable in GitHub Actions. Additionally, you will need to define the `CHECKLY_ACCOUNT_ID`, which can also be found in your Checkly Dashboard under User Settings > General.

To complete the setup, update the `checkly.config.ts` file with your own email address and production URL.

### Useful commands

#### Bundle Analyzer

Next.js Boilerplate includes a built-in bundle analyzer. It can be used to analyze the size of your JavaScript bundles. To begin, run the following command:

```shell
npm run build-stats
```

By running the command, it'll automatically open a new browser window with the results.

### VSCode information (optional)

If you are VSCode user, you can have a better integration with VSCode by installing the suggested extension in `.vscode/extension.json`. The starter code comes up with Settings for a seamless integration with VSCode. The Debug configuration is also provided for frontend and backend debugging experience.

With the plugins installed in your VSCode, ESLint and Prettier can automatically fix the code and display errors. The same applies to testing: you can install the VSCode Vitest extension to automatically run your tests, and it also shows the code coverage in context.

Pro tips: if you need a project wide-type checking with TypeScript, you can run a build with <kbd>Cmd</kbd> + <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>B</kbd> on Mac.
